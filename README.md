# Endorphin.Core

This project provides infrastructure for the development of scientific instrument control software. It was developed by the University of Warwick EPR group where it is used to run a confocal microscope and a high field EPR spectrometer. We are in the process of migrating our instrument control projects to open source. In the process, we will first migrate the infrastructure projects to GitHub and consume them via NuGet, then the projects for individual instruments, before finally open-sourcing experiments which integrate several instruments. More details and documentation to follow...
